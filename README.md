## [hello](https://nuclearc.github.io/)

I am a programmer. I am interested in game development, computer graphics, algorithms, system programming, low-level programming, and some other stuff that I cannot really remember right now.

My current projects are:
- âš¡ A game engine based on the Vulkan API with a highly customizable and modular system (think Source Engine)
- ðŸ”­ Phantom Protocol (teamwork): a first-person shooter game with a unique mechanic: https://github.com/NuclearC/cs218-final
- ðŸ“« VoidWars (teamwork): a 2D top-down multiplayer shooter game written in Java: https://github.com/NuclearC/cs120-final

Some other s#it not worth calling a project:
- Datastructs: A collection of userful data structures: https://github.com/NuclearC/datastructs
- Plotrust: A helper program to help me solve some linear ODE's: https://github.com/NuclearC/plotrust
- Font-Rendering: A small library for abstracting the FreeType API: https://github.com/NuclearC/font-rendering
- Games: A collection of small games I make when I am utterly bored: https://github.com/NuclearC/games
-  ðŸ¤” Toxicity Checker: A program for Windows to help you less use swear words: https://github.com/NuclearC/toxicity-checker

Some old projects of mine that are kinda worth mentioning:
- https://github.com/NuclearC/educational-project: Simple x86 interpreter written in C++. Can decode and run simplest ELF files.
- https://github.com/NuclearC/websocket: Plain websocket implementation on top of [libuv](https://libuv.org/)
